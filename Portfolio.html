						<h5>Problem</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							Imagine a situation - a group of people in a meeting, trying to brainstorm or discuss ideas by collaborating and putting forth their viewpoints. This group of people consist of people who can hear and speak comfortably, and those who are hard-of-hearing or have difficulty speaking. In such a scenario, it becomes difficult for the latter set of people to easily put their points forth or contribute equally to the discussions. The reasons for this might be:
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							- It could be difficult for the interpreter to keep up with the pace if a speaker is talking fast and would take more time to interpret and explain to the hard-of-hearing individual.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							- If there are multiple speakers speaking, it would be difficult for the interpreter to explain (by pointing out) and the deaf individual to understand whoâ€™s speaking what, and it could lead to a confusion.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h5>Solution</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							An application that converts speech-to-text and assists the user in keeping track of the points in the discussion. When a person in the team speaks, the application converts the transcribes the speech and displays it on the screen for the hard-of-hearing team members. The application would have the capability of separating each speaker so that the deaf member is aware of who the speaker is whenever someone speaks.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							In cases where the deaf member feels that a speaker is speaking fast (text conversion is fast) and that it is difficult to follow what the person is saying, or if they want to put forth their own points, or ask a question, the application has clickable buttons which on clicking, produce a sound as to notify the speakers that the deaf member has requested for a pause. This would help the discussion to progress smoothly while providing every member in the team to having equal chance to voice their ideas and have a say in the discussion.

						<h5>Problem</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Youâ€™re at an official party and someone gives you their business card. Or, youâ€™re talking to a potential recruiter and they hand over their business card to you. And once you get home, you manually enter their first and last name, phone number, email address, the company they work for and their designation.<br><br>
							Itâ€™s ok if itâ€™s just one or two people, but, imagine yourself at a gathering where people have come with the intention of networking and now you have many more than just 2-3 business cards shared with you. In this scenario, you wouldnâ€™t want to spend time manually putting in peopleâ€™s information on your phone.<br><br>
							How nice would it be if the business cards had also a little QR code on them which contained all the information that was visible on the card; and then just scanning this code would store all contacts details of that specific individual on your phone. Thatâ€™s what this app does!
						</p>
						<br>
						<h5>Solution</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
								The application opens with a splash screen and then opens the â€˜Cameraâ€™ tab to scan the QR code on a business card. Once the code has been scanned by the phone camera, a prompt comes up showing the data and asking for confirmation to save the information. On clicking â€˜Saveâ€™, the data gets stored into the phone contact list as well as the app itself. The â€˜Contact Listâ€™ tab shows a list of the people whose business card were scanned using the app and clicking on one of the names of the people, opens a page which displays their information, including the bar code in case it must be shared with another person. The â€˜Accountâ€™ tab shows the personal information of the user of the device, including the bar code which contains that information.

						<h5>Problem</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							Keeping track of my finances wasn't difficult for me! I was so much in love with Google Keep that I wanted to put every information in there - including the amount of money I spent every month! So, while I was responsible enough to make sure I didn't spend over my budget, I kept track of how much I spent every month, in Keep; and added the amount to the amount that was already spent in that month.
						</p>
						<div class = "img_Keep_div text-center">
							<img src="Images/BudgetMe/Keep.jpg" alt="Google Keep">
							<p>[Monthly Expense in Google Keep]</p>
						</div>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							Even though it wasn't difficult to just add, it was an inefficient way. That's when I decided to build an app to keep track of my expenses!
						</p>
						<br>
						<h5>Solution</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
								To put the idea into action, I chose the simplest tool - pencil and paper! Before I started designing, I imagined how I wanted my app to look. I started with deciding the different components my app would have, which in this case were:
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
								-	A home page with two buttons, one leading to a page to enter purchase description, and another leading to a page showing the different purchases made.
								<br>
								-	A page to enter the date, amount and description of purchase.
								<br>
								-	A page that displays all the months of a year (as buttons), and on clicking on one of those, it opens a modal which displays the purchases for that month.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
								Once I drew these on paper, I used Figma to create the prototypes of these and added some colors. I decided on a coffee-colored theme (shades of brown). I feel itâ€™s best when an app is developed to be simple and intuitive!
						</p>
						<div class= "container col-lg-12 text-center">
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-lg-3 text-center budgetMeImages">
									<img src="Images/BudgetMe/HomeScreen.png" alt="">
									<p>[Home Screen]</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-3 text-center budgetMeImages">
									<img src="Images/BudgetMe/SpentMoneyScreen.png" alt="">
									<p>[Spent Money Screen]</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-3 text-center budgetMeImages">
									<img src="Images/BudgetMe/HistoryScreen.png" alt="">
									<p>[History Screen]</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-3 text-center budgetMeImages">
									<img src="Images/BudgetMe/ModalScreen.png" alt="">
									<p>[Modal Screen]</p>
									</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
								The first screen shows two buttons. Clicking on the â€˜I spent more moneyâ€™ button takes you to the screen which lets you enter the date, amount and description of the purchase made. On filling this information, and clicking on the green check button, this information gets saved and you are redirected to the home page. If the red cross button is pressed, the information is not saved and you are redirected to the home page.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
								On the home page, if you click on â€˜Historyâ€™, it takes you to a page with the months listed as buttons, and on clicking on one of the month buttons, a modal opens up which shows the purchases made during that month, along with the total amount spent (on the header).

						<h5>Problem</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							A new school year is approaching and the orientation team is looking to you for some design expertise. Please create your proposal based on one option from the prompts listed below:
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							<i>Option 1</i><br>
							Design an experience for new students to browse, search, and propose new student organizations. Provide your overall process, a wireframe flow, and one to two screens at higher fidelity.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							<i>Option 2</i><br>
							Design an experience for students to discover orientation events and craft a visual system to accommodate different types of events: sports, music, visual arts, social groups, and volunteering events. Provide high-fidelity mocks for searching, browsing, and viewing the details for these different events.
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							<i>Option 3</i><br>
							Design a digital billboard experience to welcome incoming students and their families. These will be displayed on various screens on campus, and will show orientation information, advertise student organizations and events, and include delightful moments of school branding. Create three motion sequences that will be looped, transitioning between the different types of content.
						</p>
						<br>
						<h5>Solution</h5>
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">
							I decided to go with Option 2.
							<br><br>
							The primary components in an orientation website would include details of events, marking them as â€˜favouriteâ€™ and registering for them.	I believe, displaying the events in the form of a list would help a user conveniently browse through them. Also, having a map of the campus that shows the locations of the events can help students find the venues easily and familiarize with the locations on the campus. Marking events as â€˜Favouriteâ€™ and registering to them will help students keep track of events they are interested in attending.
