                  A mid-sized, third-fastest-growing U.S. home insurance provider, on a trajectory to reach $1 billion in revenue, sought to overhaul its public-facing website. The existing site suffered from an outdated design, poor usability, and low conversion rates, failing to reflect the company's market position as a tech-forward industry leader. I joined the project as one of two UX/UI designers tasked with redesigning the user experience from the ground up. We began with a proof of concept (POC) for the home page, successfully winning the contract, and then proceeded to a full-scale redesign of their marketing website.

The light theme projected friendliness and the use of airy / negative space gave the impression of modernness. Until now, we had been working with the client's marketing team and receiving feedback from them. However, in a demo with the CEO and CTO, the hybrid design was met with disapproval. The upper leadership had envisioned a dark, and bold theme. This was a critical moment. We quickly pivoted, revisiting our design explorations and adopted them into a sophisticated dark theme. Over a few iterations involving continuous feedback from the upper leadership, the revised mockup was presented to the client, including the CEO and CTO, and it was met with an enthusiastic approval.
