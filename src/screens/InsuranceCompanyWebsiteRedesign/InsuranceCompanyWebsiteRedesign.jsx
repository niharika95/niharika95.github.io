                    A mid-sized, third-fastest-growing U.S. home insurance provider, on a trajectory to reach $1 billion in revenue, sought to overhaul its public-facing website. The existing site suffered from an outdated design, poor usability, and low conversion rates, failing to reflect the company's market position as a tech-forward industry leader. I joined the project as one of two UX/UI designers tasked with redesigning the user experience from the ground up. We began with a proof of concept (POC) for the home page, successfully winning the contract, and then proceeded to a full-scale redesign of their marketing website.

                    The client serves two distinct primary audiences: Customers (homeowners) and Agents (B2B partners). We created personas, informed by demographic data provided by the client. Creating these personas was critical as it built empathy, focused our decision-making on user needs, and created alignment between our team and the client who we were building for.

                        <li><p><span className='font-bold'>Strategic Alignment:</span> A key debate emerged: should the site have separate experiences for agents and customers, or a unified view? Since agents were as crucial to their business as customers, we presented the pros and cons of each approach. After several discussions with the client and iterations, we landed on a finalized, user-centric sitemap.</p></li>

The light theme projected friendliness and the use of airy / negative space gave the impression of modernness. Until now, we had been working with the client's marketing team and receiving feedback from them. However, in a demo with the CEO and CTO, the hybrid design was met with disapproval. The upper leadership had envisioned a dark, and bold theme. This was a critical moment. We quickly pivoted, revisiting our design explorations and adopted them into a sophisticated dark theme. Over a few iterations involving continuous feedback from the upper leadership, the revised mockup was presented to the client, including the CEO and CTO, and it was met with an enthusiastic approval. This was our finalized direction.</p>
