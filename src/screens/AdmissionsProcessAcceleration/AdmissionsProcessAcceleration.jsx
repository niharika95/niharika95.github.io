                  University admissions counselors were burdened by a manual,

                  The university's admissions process was facing a critical

                  institutional rules. This workflow was not just inefficient;

                  We fostered a close partnership with university stakeholders

                  had collected from counselors, we were able to map the core
                  challenges of the manual workflow and define our user-centered

                  the initial, heavy-lifting analysis of a student's transcript.

              The most rewarding aspect of this project was seeing the tangible
              impact on the counselors' work. By collaborating closely with
              their managers, we gained a deep understanding of their daily
              frustrations, which led to a 60% jump in productivity. This was
              meaningful because it represented more than a metric — it meant
              less stress for the counselors and a real advantage for the
              university, proving that when you focus on making people's work
              lives better, everyone wins.

            <p className='font-mulish text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-[800px]'>
              As a future step, I would want to build on this success by
              automating the initial data entry. Allowing the system to scan and
              auto-fill transcript information would reduce their workload even
              further and be a powerful next enhancement.
