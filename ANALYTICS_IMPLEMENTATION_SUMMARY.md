## üéØ Key Features

### Project Type Differentiation
- Automatically distinguishes between **personal** and **professional** projects
- Enables comparison of performance between project types
- Personal projects: femhealth, swiftbikes, svaasthya
- Professional projects: All others

### Card Location Tracking
- Tracks which card location drives more engagement:
  - `home_v1` - Personal project cards on Home.jsx
  - `project_grid` - Professional project cards on ProjectGrid.jsx

### Position Tracking
- Each project card has a position index (0-based)
- Personal projects: indices 0-2
- Professional projects: indices 0-3

### User Journey Tracking
- Session-based tracking with journey start time
- User type detection (new vs returning visitors)
- Session number tracking

### Development-Friendly
- Console logging in development mode for easy debugging
- Safe execution (checks for gtag availability)
- Graceful handling of missing data

## üìà What You Can Now Measure

### Project Performance
1. Which of the 7 projects gets the most views?
2. Which projects get clicked most from homepage?
3. Do personal or professional projects perform better?
4. What's the click-through rate for each project?
5. Which card location (home_v1 vs project_grid) drives more engagement?

### User Engagement
6. How long do users spend on each project?
7. What percentage scroll through entire projects?
8. At what point do users typically leave?
9. Which pages have the highest engagement?

### Navigation Patterns
10. What's the typical user journey through the site?
11. Which navigation links are used most?
12. How often do users return to homepage via logo?

### External Links
13. Which external links get clicked most?
14. How many users download the resume?
15. What's the conversion rate from viewing to clicking external links?

### Device & User Insights

17. How do new vs returning visitors behave differently?
18. What's the average session depth?

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Enable GA4 Debug Mode

In your browser console, run:
```javascript
window.gtag('config', 'G-2K28L93XWR', { debug_mode: true });
```

Or install the [Google Analytics Debugger Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna)

### 2. Test Scenarios

**Test Project Tracking:**
1. Navigate to homepage
2. Click on a project card (e.g., FemHealth)
3. Verify `click_project_card` event fires
4. Verify `view_project` event fires on project page
5. Scroll through the project page
6. Verify `scroll_depth` events fire at milestones

**Test Navigation:**
1. Click "Projects" in header
2. Verify `navigation_click` event fires
3. Click logo to return home
4. Verify `logo_click` event fires

**Test External Links:**
1. Click email link

üìä GA4 Event: view_project {project_name: "femhealth", ...}
```

  3. view_project
  4. external_link_click
- **Analysis**: Conversion rate at each step

### 3. Engagement Report
- **Metrics**: Avg time_seconds, scroll_depth, engaged sessions
- **Dimensions**: page_type, project_name, viewport_size
- **Segmentation**: New vs returning visitors

### 4. Personal vs Professional Projects
- **Metric**: Views, clicks, engagement time
- **Dimension**: project_type
